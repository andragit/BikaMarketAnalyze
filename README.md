# üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Analyzing Bike Market Data
This repository contains the code and data files for a project that analyzes bike sales data. The project aims to uncover insights and trends from the data using various analytical and visualization.

## Objectives
utilizing MSExcel for analyzing data to determine which demographic factors are most strongly associated with costumer purchase to creating effective marketing strategies. By analyzing sales by demographic factors such as age, gender, income level, and location so MRTE can identify patterns and trends in consumer behavior. For instance, they may discover that a certain age group tends to purchase a specific type of product or that customers in a particular location have unique preferences.

Once these patterns have been identified, MRTE can then create targeted marketing strategies that cater to the specific needs and preferences of different customer segments. For example, if they discover that customers in a particular age group prefer eco-friendly products, they can create marketing campaigns that emphasize the environmentally-friendly features of their products.

In addition to helping MRTE create effective marketing strategies, analyzing sales by demographic factors can also provide valuable insights into the overall health of the market. By identifying which demographic factors are most strongly associated with customer purchase, MRTE can gain a better understanding of the market‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses, and identify potential areas for growth.
